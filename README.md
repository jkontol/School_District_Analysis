# The Analysis of a School District

##Purpose
For this project we will analyze the performance of a school district. Student data will be merged with school data to analyze performance by student, by school, and by district. Fifteen schools and 39,190 schools will be assessed based on math performance and reading performance.

##The Process

Before diving into the analysis it is important to be working with a clean dataset without missing chunks of information. Once we remove any formatting errors, and fill in any missing data we can begin looking into how this district is perfoming.

#The Analysis

By merging the data together we can get a better view of how each student is performing, and then roll up those results to grade level, school, and then district.
